Semi-Pervault MCP is a local memory server built around Pervault's four-layer memory architecture. It stores important facts, preferences, decisions, project context, and relationship notes in a local SQLite database, then exposes that memory as MCP tools for agentic workflows.

The goal is simple: let your AI tools remember useful context across sessions without sending your private memory store to a hosted service.

<br />

## Why It Exists

Most AI tools are brilliant in the moment and forgetful by design. Semi-Pervault MCP gives them a durable, inspectable memory surface:

| Need | What Semi-Pervault Provides |
|---|---|
| Remember me across sessions | Long-term local storage for facts, preferences, decisions, and progress |
| Recall the right context | Hybrid retrieval across facts, full text, embeddings, and graph context |
| Keep memory explainable | Evidence trails, admission scores, and revision audit history |
| Stay private by default | SQLite on your machine, with a loopback-only daemon |
| Avoid MCP process fragility | A thin MCP bridge forwards to a resident daemon that owns background work |

<br />

## What It Does

- **Stores long-term memory** for facts, preferences, decisions, events, relationships, and project state.
- **Retrieves with hybrid search** across structured facts, full-text search, embeddings, and graph context.
- **Builds stable persona context** from repeated preferences and high-confidence traits.
- **Extracts knowledge graph links** between people, projects, topics, and events.
- **Generates reflections** through a background consolidation loop.
- **Explains beliefs** with supporting memories, confidence, admission scores, and audit trail.
- **Keeps data local-first** with SQLite storage and a loopback daemon.

<br />

## Use Cases

Semi-Pervault MCP is most useful when your AI assistant needs continuity:

| Use case | Example memory |
|---|---|
| Personal assistant context | "I prefer concise technical explanations with concrete next steps." |
| Project continuity | "Semi-Pervault MCP uses a thin MCP bridge and a resident FastAPI daemon." |
| Research and study notes | "I am studying data science and engineering at HKU." |
| Decision tracking | "We chose SQLite-first storage to keep memory local and inspectable." |
| Relationship and collaboration context | "Alice owns backend reliability decisions for Project X." |

Try asking your MCP client:

```text
Remember that I am building a local-first memory MCP server called Semi-Pervault.
```

Then later:

```text
What do you remember about my memory MCP project, and why?
```

The second question can use `memory_search`, `persona_get`, or `memory_why` depending on the context.

<br />

## Architecture

This repository is the MCP product slice of the larger Pervault memory system. It is split into three boundaries:

| Area | Role |
|---|---|
| `apps/mcp_host/` | Thin MCP bridge. It exposes tools over stdio and forwards calls to the local daemon. |
| `backend/` | Resident FastAPI daemon. It owns HTTP APIs, auth, background jobs, and all writes to `data.db`. |
| `packages/memory_core/` | Framework-free memory kernel: schema, models, write pipeline, retrieval, graph, persona, reflections, and consolidation. |

```text
MCP client
    |
    | stdio
    v
apps/mcp_host/server.py
    |
    | 127.0.0.1:8000 + X-Pervault-Token
    v
backend daemon
    |
    v
memory_core
    |
    v
local SQLite
```

The MCP host intentionally does not open the database or run background loops. The backend daemon is the only writer of the local memory database.

<br />

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `memory_store` | Store a long-term memory item. |
| `memory_search` | Retrieve relevant memories with hybrid search. |
| `memory_graph` | Query graph context for a topic. |
| `memory_update` | Revise an existing memory. |
| `persona_get` | Read stable user persona traits. |
| `reflections_list` | Read higher-level reflections generated by the background agent. |
| `memory_why` | Explain a belief with supporting memories, scores, and audit trail. |
| `memory_stats` | Show memory counts and admission statistics. |

<br />

## Quick Start

### Important: model/API setup

Semi-Pervault MCP is a memory layer, not a model provider. You still need an AI client or runtime that can call MCP tools.

There are two separate API layers:

| Layer | What you need |
|---|---|
| **AI client / model runtime** | Claude Desktop, Codex, and similar cloud-model clients must be configured with their own account or API access before they can use this MCP server. OpenClaw / Hermes-style local runtimes do not need a cloud API for the client side if the local model is already installed and running. |
| **Semi-Pervault enrichment** | `OPENAI_API_KEY` and embedding keys are optional for basic storage, but needed for LLM enrichment, embeddings, stronger hybrid retrieval, and some background intelligence. Without them, the daemon still stores memories and falls back to non-vector retrieval paths. |

If the MCP client cannot call a model yet, Semi-Pervault will not fix that part. Start your client/runtime first, then connect this memory server.

### Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/)

### 1. Start the local daemon

From the project root, double-click `RUN.command`, or run:

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
uv run python -m uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

The daemon binds to `127.0.0.1` only.

On first use it creates a local pairing token at:

```text
~/.pervault/core_token
```

The default database path is:

```text
~/.pervault/data.db
```

Set `PERVAULT_DB_PATH` if you want to store the database somewhere else.

### 2. Connect an MCP client

Claude Desktop example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pervault-memory": {
      "command": "<absolute path to uv>",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "<absolute project path>/apps/mcp_host",
        "run",
        "python",
        "server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Find your `uv` path with:

```bash
which uv
```

Restart your MCP client after editing its config.

Bridge-specific details live in [`apps/mcp_host/README.md`](apps/mcp_host/README.md).

<br />

## Configuration

The backend config template is [`backend/.env.example`](backend/.env.example).

For a first local test, you can leave provider keys empty and use the basic memory path. Add LLM and embedding keys when you want enrichment, vector retrieval, persona extraction, graph extraction, and stronger reflections.

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `LLM_MODEL` | LLM settings used by enrichment and routing. |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `EMBEDDING_BASE_URL`, `EMBEDDING_DIM` | Embedding settings for vector retrieval. |
| `PERVAULT_DB_PATH` | SQLite database location. Defaults to `~/.pervault/data.db` in daemon usage. |
| `AUTH_PASSWORD`, `API_KEY`, `SESSION_SECRET` | Backend auth/session settings for HTTP routes. |
| `CONSOLIDATION_SCHEDULER_ENABLED`, `WEIGHT_DECAY_SCHEDULER_ENABLED`, `SLEEP_AGENT_ENABLED` | Background maintenance toggles. |

If embedding credentials are not configured, retrieval falls back to non-vector search paths.

## Development

Run checks from each package directory:

```bash
# memory kernel
cd packages/memory_core
env PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX=/tmp/pervault-pycache uv run python -m pytest tests/ -q

# backend daemon
cd backend
env PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX=/tmp/pervault-pycache uv run python -m pytest tests/ -q

# MCP bridge
cd apps/mcp_host
uv run python -m pytest -q --ignore=tests/e2e_roundtrip.py
```

<br />

## Design Notes

- The daemon is local-first and SQLite-first.
- The MCP bridge is deliberately thin and stateless.
- `memory_core` is framework-free and guarded against web-framework imports.
- Long-running side effects are handled by the daemon, not the MCP stdio process.
- Data is private by default, but external LLM or embedding providers may receive text you send to them through configured API keys.
