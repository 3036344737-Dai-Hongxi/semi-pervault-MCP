# Semi-Pervault MCP Launch Kit

This document collects the pieces that make the repository easier to understand, search, and share.

## Repository Description

Use this for the GitHub About description:

```text
Local-first long-term memory MCP server for AI agents, with SQLite storage, hybrid retrieval, persona extraction, graph context, and explainable memory.
```

Shorter version:

```text
Local-first long-term memory MCP server for AI agents.
```

## Setup Caveat To Mention

Use this whenever you share the project, because it prevents the most common setup confusion:

```text
Semi-Pervault MCP is the memory layer, not the model runtime. Claude Desktop / Codex-style clients still need their own account or API setup. OpenClaw / Hermes-style local runtimes do not need a cloud API on the client side if the local model is already running. Semi-Pervault's own LLM and embedding keys are optional for basic storage, but recommended for enrichment, vector retrieval, persona extraction, and graph context.
```

## Suggested Topics

Add these in the repository About panel:

```text

local-first
sqlite
knowledge-graph

personal-ai
```

## Profile README Template

Create a public repository named exactly like your GitHub username, then put this in its `README.md`.

```markdown
# Hi, I am Henry

## Featured Project

### Semi-Pervault MCP

Local-first long-term memory MCP server for AI agents.

- SQLite-backed private memory

- Local-first software
- Personal memory systems
- Retrieval and knowledge graphs
- Python backend engineering
```

## Username Notes

Current username:

```text
3036344737-Dai-Hongxi
```

It is usable, but it is long and hard to say out loud. For a public portfolio, a shorter username is easier to remember, search, and put on resumes.

Better directions:

```text
daihongxi
henrydai
henry-dai
daihongxi-ai
henrydai-ai
```

Before changing a GitHub username, remember:

- Old profile and repository URLs usually redirect, but it is still better to update links you control.
- Local git remotes may need `git remote set-url`.
- Package names, website links, badges, and README links should be checked after the rename.
- If the current username is already used in school or project submissions, change it only when you are ready to update those links.

### One-liner

```

### Longer post

```text
I just published Semi-Pervault MCP, a local-first memory layer for MCP-compatible AI clients like Claude Desktop and Cursor.

It stores long-term memory in local SQLite, exposes memory tools over MCP, and supports hybrid retrieval, persona extraction, graph context, background reflections, and evidence tracing.

Important setup note: it is the memory layer, not the model runtime. Claude Desktop / Codex-style clients still need their own account or API setup; OpenClaw / Hermes-style local runtimes can run without a cloud API on the client side if the local model is already running.

The main design choice is keeping the MCP process thin: it forwards tool calls to a resident local daemon that owns storage and background work.

## Where To Share

Start with communities that already care about AI agents, local-first tools, or MCP:

- GitHub profile pinned repositories
- LinkedIn portfolio post
- X / Twitter build log
- Reddit communities such as LocalLLaMA, ClaudeAI, Python, or self-hosted AI groups
- Discord communities around Claude, Cursor, MCP, local AI, and agent tooling
- HKU project portfolio, resume, or personal website
